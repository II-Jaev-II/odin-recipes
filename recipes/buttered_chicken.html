    <h2>The best dish for chicken lovers!</h2>
    <p>A great deal of restaurants already sell their own delicious Garlic Fried Chicken. After all, the mix of a garlic-y flavor with the light, somewhat neutral taste of chicken has been proven time and time again as a powerful combination.</p>
    <p>This recipe uses that element to its advantage, while making the chicken even more tender and irresistible with a lovely buttery taste! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>2 heads garlic chopped</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Knorr Liquid Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Â½ cup unsalted butter melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons parsley chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups cooking oil</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spatchcock the chicken. Rub Knorr liquid seasoning all over. Let it stay for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine garlic and 1 cup cooking oil in a small pot. Cook in low heat setting until the garlic turns golden brown. Filter the garlic using a kitchen strainer. Set both the toasted garlic and garlic oil aside.</li>
        <li>Crack the egg in a bowl and add milk. Whisk until well blended. Spread the mixture all over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken in flour. Make sure that the chicken gets completely coated with flour. Let it stay for 10 minutes. This will ensure that the flour sticks will stick well.</li>
        <li>Combine garlic oil with 2 cups cooking oil. Heat to 325F.</li>
        <li>Deep-fry the chicken for 13 to 16 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the butter mixture by melting 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan. Add salt, ground black pepper, parsley, and water. Turn off heat.</li>
        <li>Arrange the chicken on a serving plate. Spoon the butter mixture and top with lots of toasted garlic. Serve. Share and enjoy!</li>
